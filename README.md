## Introduction

This module provides a comprehensive guide to LangChain, a versatile framework for building AI applications with complex workflows. You will learn about different chat models, prompt templates, chains, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques.

## Chat Models

Understand the various chat models available in LangChain, how to configure them, and their use cases. These models are the backbone of interactive AI applications, enabling dynamic conversations and context-aware responses.

## Prompt Templates

Learn about prompt templates, which are essential for structuring the input to your AI models. Prompt templates help in standardizing the interaction format, making it easier to manage and modify prompts.

## Chains

Chains are sequences of operations that process data step-by-step. This section covers different types of chains and their implementations:

### Basic Chain

The simplest form of a chain, processing data in a linear sequence.

### Extended Chain

An enhanced version of the basic chain, incorporating additional steps or more complex logic.

### Parallel Chain

Chains that execute multiple operations simultaneously, improving efficiency and performance.

### Branching

Chains that diverge based on conditions or inputs, enabling more dynamic and flexible workflows.

## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

RAG combines retrieval of relevant documents with generation of responses, providing more informed and accurate outputs. This section includes:

### Vector Store Example

An example of using vector stores to efficiently retrieve relevant documents based on input queries.

### RAG Example

A practical implementation of RAG, demonstrating how to combine retrieval and generation for enhanced responses.
